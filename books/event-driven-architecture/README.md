## 🗺️ Book Overview

This book answers the critical questions for building production event-driven systems:

- 🏗️ **What is EDA and why does it matter?** — Principles, evolution, and comparison to other styles
- 📨 **How do events flow through systems?** — Producers, brokers, consumers, and event lifecycle
- 🔀 **What are the key patterns?** — Pub/Sub, Event Sourcing, CQRS, Sagas, and more
- 🛡️ **How do you keep things reliable?** — Idempotency, ordering, exactly-once delivery
- ☁️ **How does EDA work in the cloud?** — Serverless, Kubernetes, managed brokers
- 🔐 **How do you secure event-driven systems?** — Auth, encryption, governance
- 📊 **How do you observe and operate EDA?** — Monitoring, tracing, debugging
