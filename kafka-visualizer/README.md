## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Premium dark-mode UI** with glassmorphism and Kafka brand colors
- ⚡ **24 interactive sections** covering core and advanced Kafka concepts
- 🎬 **Animated demos** — click buttons to see Kafka concepts come alive
- 📱 **Responsive design** — works on desktop and tablet
- 🧠 **Interview-ready** — covers common Kafka questions with visual explanations
- 🚫 **Zero dependencies** — plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step

| 02 | **Topics & Partitions** | Drag slider to see 1–8 partitions |
| 03 | **Producers & Message Flow** | Toggle Round-Robin vs Key-Based, Send/Burst buttons |
| 04 | **Consumer Groups** | Dual sliders, SVG arrows, idle detection, throughput metrics |
| 05 | **Message Ordering** | See per-partition vs global ordering proof |
| 06 | **Replication & Fault Tolerance** | Kill Leader / Restore, acks=0/1/all simulation |
| 07 | **High Throughput** | 6 interactive vizs: Sequential I/O, Zero-Copy, Batching, Page Cache, Partitioning, Pull vs Push |
| 09 | **Consumer Group Rebalancing** | Add/Remove/Crash consumers, Eager vs Cooperative timeline |
| 10 | **Idempotent Producers** | Retry animation with/without idempotency, delivery guarantee cards |
| 11 | **Kafka Transactions** | Atomic pipeline success/failure, transaction state machine |
| 12 | **Saga Pattern** | Choreography vs Orchestration, compensation on failure |
| 13 | **Consumer Offsets** | Consume Next / Commit / Crash consumer offset pointer |
