# Chapter 1: Introduction to Building AI Applications with Foundation Models

> *"AI Engineering is distinct from traditional ML Engineering"*

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### AI Engineering vs. ML Engineering

| Aspect | Traditional ML Engineering | AI Engineering |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Data** | Tabular data, feature engineering | Text/multimodal, context construction |
| **Models** | Train from scratch | Adapt pre-trained foundation models |
| **Key Skills** | Feature engineering, model training | Prompt engineering, RAG, finetuning |
| **Annotations** | Extensive labeling | Fewer manual labels needed |
| **Iteration** | Retrain models | Update prompts, context, or finetune |

### What is a Foundation Model?

- A **large pre-trained model** that can be adapted to many tasks
- Includes both **LLMs** (Large Language Models) and **LMMs** (Large Multimodal Models)
- Trained on massive datasets, they develop emergent capabilities
- Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral

### Building a Defensible AI Product

- **How to think about defensibility** when models are commoditized
- Focus on **data moats**, **workflow integration**, and **user experience**
- The model itself is rarely the competitive advantage

## ❓ Questions to Reflect On

1. How does the shift from "build models" to "adapt models" change the required skill set?
2. What makes an AI product defensible when everyone has access to the same foundation models?
3. Where does your current expertise fit in the AI Engineering Stack?
4. What are the trade-offs between using commercial APIs vs open-source models?

## 🛠️ Practice Ideas

- [ ] Map out an AI application idea using the AI Engineering Stack
- [ ] Compare 2-3 foundation model providers (pricing, capabilities, trade-offs)
- [ ] Identify which layer of the stack you want to focus on first
